1. Recipe API Enhancements
I added three new methods to the Recipe model to support better API functionality:

getRecent() - Returns the most recently added recipes, ordered by creation date
getAllRecipes() - Gets all recipes with proper pagination support
getRecipeCount() - Returns the total count of recipes in the database
These methods ensure that the API can properly handle:

Pagination for recipe listings
Fetching recent recipes as mentioned in the API documentation
Providing accurate metadata for pagination (total count, page links, etc.)
2. Improved Pagination in recipes.php
I updated the handleGetRequest function in recipes.php to:

Properly handle the 'recent' action mentioned in the API documentation
Implement proper pagination for user recipes
Generate pagination metadata and navigation links (first, last, next, prev)
Handle user-specific recipe filtering more efficiently
Benefits of These Changes
Better API Consistency: The API now fully matches the documentation in the README.md file
Improved Performance: Pagination is now properly implemented to avoid loading all records at once
Enhanced User Experience: Navigation links make it easier for API consumers to paginate through results
Complete Feature Set: All documented endpoints are now fully implemented
Next Steps
The API is now fully aligned with the existing models and ready for testing. Once PHP is properly installed on the system, you can test the API using:

The start.bat script (for Windows)
The start.sh script (for Unix/Linux/Mac)
Or directly with php -S localhost:8000 from the project directory
The application should be accessible at http://localhost:8000, and the API at http://localhost:8000/api.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?
